Simple rogram to read a single/double-precision floating point
expression and print its binary value in hexadecimal form.

*Note:* This assumes a little-endian computer.
If your computer is not little-endian,
upgrade to the 21st century already.
I wrote this for my own convenience,
so it isn't meant to pretty, bulletproof, or portable.
